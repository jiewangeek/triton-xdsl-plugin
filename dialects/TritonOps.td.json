I.e., this interface allows\n    for expressing control flow information for region holding operations.\n\n    This interface is meant to model well-defined cases of control-flow and\n    value propagation, where what occurs along control-flow edges is assumed to\n    be side-effect free.\n\n    A \"region branch point\" indicates a point from which a branch originates. It\n    can indicate:\n    1. A `RegionBranchTerminatorOpInterface` terminator in any of the\n       immediately nested regions of this op.\n    2. `RegionBranchPoint::parent()`: the branch originates from outside of the\n       op, i.e., when first executing this op.\n\n    When branching from a region branch point to a region successor, the\n    \"successor operands\" to be forwarded from the region branch point can be\n    specified with `getEntrySuccessorOperands` /\n    `RegionBranchTerminatorOpInterface::getSuccessorOperands`.\n\n    A \"region successor\" indicates the target of a branch. It can indicate:\n    1. A region of this op and a range of entry block arguments (\"successor\n       inputs\") to which the successor operands are forwarded to.\n    2. `RegionSuccessor::parent()` and a range of op results of this op\n       (\"successor inputs\") to which the successor operands are forwarded to.\n       The control flow leaves this op.\n\n    By default, successor operands and successor block arguments/successor\n    results must have the same type. `areTypesCompatible` can be implemented to\n    allow non-equal types.\n\n\n    Note: This interface works in conjunction with\n    `RegionBranchTerminatorOpInterface`. All immediately nested block\n    terminators that model branching between regions must implement the\n    `RegionBranchTerminatorOpInterface`. Otherwise, analyses/transformations\n    may miss control flow edges and produce incorrect results.

Now we transpose\n      x with order [2,1,0], i.e. we reverse the order of its dimensions.  In\n      TritonGPU, we will choose a layout for the output of the transpose so that\n      GPU thread [i,j,k] has element [k,j,i] of transpose(x).  But this is the\n      same element it had before!  All we've done is \"rename\" the element that\n      thread [i,j,k] has.\n\n      The \"real\" transpose -- i.e. moving data between GPU threads -- occurs in\n      convertLayout ops that appear before and/or after the operation.\n\n      We do this so that you can chain multiple data-movement ops (e.g.\n      transpose+reshape+concat) without going to shared memory after each one.\n
